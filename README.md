# Incident Report

This is an example of an incident report I was taught to create, which can be found in the file "Incident Report.pdf." The report is based on a fictional scenario detailed in the file "Scenario.pdf."

Important skills I gained from this include the ability to analyse security incidents, think critically about how I communicate information, and consider my audience when conveying findings.
